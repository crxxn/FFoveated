# FFoveated :movie_camera:

A workbench for developing and researching foveated video codecs and applications.

## Foveal Vision :eyes:

The acuity of the human eye rapidly decreases outside of a circular region of
roughly 2.5Â° of visual angle around the current center of fixation. We are
limited to perceive imagery in the periphery at a significantly reduced
resolution due to the density of photoreceptive cells on the retina.
A concise introduction to the biological background can be found in
[Foundations of Vision](https://foundationsofvision.stanford.edu/chapter-3-the-photoreceptor-mosaic/)
by Brian A. Wandell, Vision Imaging Science and Technology Lab, Stanford.

## Example
Click on the image below for a short 1080p demo clip (~1.5M) that was
compressed using [x264](https://www.videolan.org/developers/x264.html):  
  
[<img src="https://oliver-wiedemann.net/static/external/github/ffoveated/video-foveated-preview.jpg">](https://oliver-wiedemann.net/static/external/github/ffoveated/video-foveated.mp4?raw=true)
  
The fixation point is set to be at the center of each frame, thus the visual
quality decreases towards the periphery. The corners are already **quite
severely degraded** and e.g. block flicker effects are clearly visible. **This
is intentional** to showcase the effects of foveated encoding.  In practice,
one would ideally use feedback from an eye-tracker to steer the compression
according to an observer's gaze in real time, which ideally renders these
impairments invisible.

## Building :hammer:
The two main components of this project are found in the `ffmpeg-foveated/` and `src/` directories.

### ffmpeg-foveated
The subtree in `ffmpeg-foveated` contains a patched fork of
[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/), which you can configure and compile its contents
as follows.  If you already have FFmpeg installed on your system you can save
time by disabling more compilation targets, however, this can lead to
compatibility issues in the future.

```bash
cd ffmpeg-foveated
./configure --enable-avcodec --enable-gpl --enable-libx264 --enable-shared
make
```

### FFoveated

Make sure to **point your linker to these patched FFmpeg libraries**,
especially `libavcodec`. Setting the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable is a
temporary way to override loading symbols from the system libraries:

```bash
export LD_PRELOAD="/path/to/FFoveated/ffmpeg-foveated/libavcodec/libavcodec.so"
```



## Implementation Details

## Application Scenarios and Limitations
This is a rather niche project that aims to optimize high quality, low
bandwidth video streaming applications with a single observer.
Prominent use cases are:

- cloud gaming, where prerendered content is served via a network
- controlling of remote controlled vehicles/drones

There are better methods available for broadcasts and on-demand streaming.
Even videotelephony probably allows for enough buffering to employ codecs
relying on more a thorough content analysis, which has undeniable benefits
over requiring a feedback-loop with an eye-tracker.
